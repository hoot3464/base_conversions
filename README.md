# Base Conversions

This repo exists to help me understand base conversions using python.

There are functions to convert decimal to binary, binary to decimal, and decimal to hexa.

There are also text files that explain what is going on in main.py, broken down into three different files.

There are also two list.py's and list.txt's that give a range of conversions which I thought was fun. It also exists for reference.
