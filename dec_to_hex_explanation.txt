Decimal to Hexadecimal Explanation:

dec_to_hex():
    
    hexa = ""

    while num > 0:
        
        remainder = num % 16
        
        if remainder < 10:
            hexa = str(remainder) + hexa
        elif remainder == 10:
            hexa = "A" + hexa
        elif remainder == 11:
            hexa = "B" + hexa
        elif remainder == 12:
            hexa = "C" + hexa
        elif remainder == 13:
            hexa = "D" + hexa
        elif remainder == 14:
            hexa = "E" + hexa
        elif remainder == 15:
            hexa = "F" + hexa
       
        num = num // 16

In this function, there are 3 steps:
1. Get the modulus of the number divided by 16
2. Add to the hexa string depending on if the remainder is less than 10 or not
3. Do integer division by 16 until the number is 0

The way this is done is similar to how decimal is converted to binary.
The advantage of hex is you can use up to 255 values within 2 digits. 
255 in hex is FF
